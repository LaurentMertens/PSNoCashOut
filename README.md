# PSNoCashOut
Convert PokerStars hand history that contains "Cashed Out" hands to one without such hands. "Cashed Out" hands are converted to "normal" hands by removing the information specific to the cashing out process. If you -- the player -- don't use the cash out feature, this will not affect your own statistics (i.e., by importing the converted hands into PokerTracker4 your statistics will be correct again, instead of missing the "Cashed Out" hands).

Very usefull as long as PokerTracker4 does not support PokerStars' cashing out process.
